raspberry-pi-raspbian-optimizations
===================================
This is a quick time saving shell script for optimizing raspberry pi (raspbian) settings and software.

This should work - must run as root:
sudo bash < <( curl https://raw.github.com/kel-nelson/raspberry-pi-raspbian-optimizations/master/run.sh )
